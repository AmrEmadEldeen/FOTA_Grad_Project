Firebase is a free, open-source platform provided by google it is efficient to be used in small and medium scaled projects 
like ours as it is easy and has a real time database, it also lets you automatically run back-end code in response 
to event triggers by fire-base features and HTTPS requests. It stores code in Google cloud and run in a managed environment.
Hex file of the new code will be uploaded to the fire-base through a GUI, this GUI will be simple and it doesnâ€™t matter which 
programming language will be used to write it as all its function is to get the hex file and upload it to the fire_base, then
the fire_base will store it in its database.
