# FOTA_Grad_Project
FOTA is abbreviation to Firmware over the air, it means that the software will be sent to the target MCU in the car through wireless method and then be flashed and run on it in a secure way. FOTA is Particularly useful when it comes to IOT systems, especially those with large numbers of connected devices that require frequent updates.
FOTA technology allows manufactures to provide efficient and timely firmware updates for handsets, which increases customer satisfaction and reduces technical support requirements, it also allows manufactures to repair bugs in sold devices by remotely installation of new software.
In this project FOTA technology will be implemented from scratch. To do so we have to take in consideration some challenges, for example memory in target MCU should be able to keep the running project,the new installed one and also the boot-loader, memory management and remapping should be done as the memory in embedded MCUs are partially limited so we have to use it efficiently, we also should make sure that the running program is not interrupted while flashing the new one to apply FOTA technology. Another challenge is the design itself as we are working with many MCUs which are target MCU(Car MCU) and telematics Unit which receives the updated hex file from the server and send it to the target MCU, so we have to program each of the MCUs separately then integrate all work. As we are using wireless way to send the code to telematics unit there will be challenges in communication also and using can bus will increase these challenges.
