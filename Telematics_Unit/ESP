This unit is put in the car (target device) also, its
main function is to keep checking if there is any
update available on the server, when there is
an available update it should be downloaded as
a hex file and stored in a puffer then sent to
the main target MCU through CAN_BUS, the
MCU used to implement this concept is known
as Node_MCU.

To implement Node_MCU concept we are using
ESP_32 as it is open-source firmware and
development kit that is used in prototyping and
building IOT products, it also has built in WiFi
module which allow it to keep connected to the
internet without any additional peripherals to
keep checking the server, it can connect to the
cloud using HTTP and MQTT protocols, it also
supports 2 wire interfacing (Can Protocol).
