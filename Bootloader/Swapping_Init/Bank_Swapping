 What is Bank Swapping:
Bank Swapping is a memory-switching technique that uses each bank to
store a different version of SW. It is useful for increasing the amount of
usable memory beyond the amount directly addressable by processor
instructions. It can be used to configure a system differently at
different times; for example, if one version is outdated and needs to be
updated, we can switch to the other bank, which supposedly has the
updated SW version.
